# AI BOS — TEST SUITE 06 — TENANT CUSTOMER

# AI BOS — FULL TEST SPECIFICATION

## Test status convention
- NOT EXECUTED = test specification exists but no running system/repository evidence yet.
- PASS = executed and evidence recorded.
- FAIL = executed and actual behavior violates expected behavior.
- BLOCKED = execution cannot proceed because required implementation/dependency is missing.
- UNKNOWN = evidence is insufficient.
- N/A = formally out of scope with evidence.

## Source discipline
This test suite is derived from the AI BOS canonical blueprint candidate, Master Build-Ready Blueprint, Master Audit Knowledge Base, locked decision/handoff material, and the completed E2E system map.
It does not invent implementation facts. Where the blueprint intentionally leaves a value configurable/open, the test checks that the system treats it as configurable rather than pretending a fixed value is canonical.

## Universal expected controls
Every applicable test must consider:
1. identity
2. authentication
3. tenant resolution
4. authorization
5. permission
6. entitlement
7. policy
8. authority
9. risk
10. source of truth
11. state transition
12. side effect
13. idempotency
14. audit
15. observability
16. failure/recovery
17. tenant isolation
18. AI boundary
19. human escalation
20. evidence


## Perspective
**Actor/System under test:** Tenant Customer

## Execution rule
This is a test specification, not a claim that the current repository passes. Every case begins as `NOT EXECUTED` until actual implementation evidence is available.

## Completion condition
All applicable cases must be executed. A suite is not PASS merely because the happy path works; negative, boundary, concurrency, failure, recovery, isolation and abuse cases must also be evidenced.
